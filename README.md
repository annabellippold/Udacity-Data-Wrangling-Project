# Udacity-Data-Wrangling-Project
### I used the Open Street Map Data of San Francisco and the Bay Area for preparing a SQL Database. With the Project_Data_Wrangling.py a sample of the data set can be created.
### In this Project only a few attributes of the data set was cleaned.
### After cleaning five .csv files were created, which can be imported to a Database to run SQL Queries.
